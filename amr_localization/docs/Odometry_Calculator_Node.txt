------ Encoder Data ------
-   Odometry Calculator Node subscribes to a Float32 Multi Array from the topic /amr/encoder_data.
-   This Float32 Array is published by the Arduino and then transformed to a ROS2 message by the ROS1-Bridge

------ Odometry Calculation Logic ------
-   The data from the encoder (float values) are turned into velocities in the x, y and z directions using the kinematic equations for a 4-Wheeled Mecanum Robot.
-   These velocities are then transformed into odometry values.
-   The values of dt, m_OdometryTimer are hard to grasp, needs further testing.

------ Transfrom Broadcaster and Odometry Publisher ------
-   Transform Broadcaster published the transfrom between the odom and base_link frame to the TF2.
-   Odometry publisher publishes the calculated odometry to the EKF Node.
